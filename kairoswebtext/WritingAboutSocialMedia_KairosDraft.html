    <p class="w3-justify">This webtext presents the learning path and project we created to
      attend to this historic time.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">Writing about Social Media is a seven-week undergraduate course at Worcester
      Polytechnic Institute that took place between January 2021 to March 2021. Sarah Riddick designed and taught this
      course, but we collaboratively refined it each week in order to suit our shared research, writing,
      and learning goals. Our primary inspiration for this collaborative work is Julia Canzoneri, Brie Cronin, Iris Finkel, Melissa Harden, Wendy Hayden, Alex Kreichman, Dana Krugle, Sarah Parente, Rasha Reda, and Christina Yim’s (2020)
      <em>Kairos</em> article called "'Stronger Together': Open Pedagogy, Digital Scholarship, and Hillary
      Clinton's Rhetorical Appeal.” In fall 2016—amidst the 2016 US Presidential election—Wendy Hayden
      offered a course at Hunter College called Democratic Rhetoric: Hillary Clinton and Beyond, which
      Hayden and her students co-created through an “open pedagogy” approach to the course (Canzoneri et
      al., 2020; see also Hegarty, 2015, p. 5). As a group, we wanted to build on Canzoneri et al.’s
      approach to learning <em>together</em> in a college course, and we wanted to explore new directions
      for this kind of collaborative work.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">We recognize that we are certainly not the only group who researched and studied
      social media rhetorics &amp; writing in the classroom during spring 2021, but we believe our project offers several
      meaningful contributions. First, we build on aspects of Canzoneri et al.’s project, namely 1)
      using open pedagogy in rhetoric &amp; writing classrooms and 2) responding to exigence in course
      design and delivery. Second, we work together as an interdisciplinary group to respond to key
      questions and concerns in the digital humanities. We believe a particular point of interest is the
      composition of our group: ten STEM students at a polytechnic institute who are working with a rhetoric
      &amp; writing professor to research rhetoric, writing, media, and technology. Although our group’s
      composition could seem like a point of weakness, we argue that it is one of our strengths. Third, we
      model how students can work towards multiple learning and professional writing goals in their rhetoric
      &amp; writing coursework. On one level, our weekly work refined our understanding of rhetoric and
      writing, including how to communicate persuasively in more familiar writing genres like blogs, reports,
       and academic research papers. On another level, we explicitly and actively connected these smaller
       weekly pieces of writing to a larger writing goal: collaboratively creating a scholarly webtext for
        <em>Kairos</em>.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">In this webtext, then, we share what emerged from our two-month pedagogical project.
       We begin by explaining how Canzoneri et al.’s work in their course informed the design and delivery of ours. Next, we offer an interactive, annotated timeline of our project, in which we showcase the work we did each week in our individual and collaborative research and writing projects, as well as in our project meetings. We conclude by sharing key outcomes of our work together, and we offer recommendations for
       future work in the areas that our project features. Our project offers these in-depth insights into researching and writing about social media in the rhetoric & writing classroom, while also pointing out opportunities for overcoming these challenges and
       constraints. In addition, our project offers these insights by centering student perspectives on and participation in shaping rhetoric &amp; writing pedagogy.</p>



  <!-- The Writing Together Section -->
  <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="contact">
    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">WRITING TOGETHER</h2>
  </body>
  </html>
      <p class="w3-justify">Three primary reasons motivated us to build on Canzoneri et al.’s project. First, this project struck a kairotic chord. Like Canzoneri et al., our group was meeting during a particularly contentious period in US politics. In a way, our respective projects bookend this period. Canzoneri et al. were working together in fall 2016, during which the 2016 US Presidential campaign ended and the Presidential election took place. In our case, we began working together in January 2021, approximately three months after the 2020 Presidential election and approximately three weeks after the former US president had been banned from social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. As someone who specializes in researching and teaching social media rhetoric & writing, Sarah (the instructor) had yet to encounter such a prominent public call for this work, and she decided to adapt the course to respond to exigence.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Second, "'Stronger Together'"" illustrates how an instructor and a group of students can work together to co-create a learning environment and a research project in rhetoric & writing classrooms. As their article explains, Canzoneri et al. are a group of undergraduate and graduate students from various disciplinary backgrounds and areas of focus who co-created their course with Wendy Hayden. They explained:</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">“Knowing the class would be an introduction to rhetorical concepts for some of the students, Hayden sought to show students the applicability of rhetorical concepts, particularly feminist rhetorical analysis, through analysis of Clinton's campaign and election rhetoric. The class was also intended to give students more engagement in analyzing the election” (Canzoneri et al., 2020).</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Our group, too, features an even wider array of disciplinary backgrounds and areas of specialization, and we worked together throughout our project to embrace our interdisciplinarity.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Third, this project demonstrates how student learning and research can contribute to conversations beyond the classroom. Indeed, as we brainstormed possible topics and research questions in our first meeting, we quickly realized we were all wrestling with similar questions and concerns related to ongoing and recent cultural events, and we saw this course and this collaborative project as an opportunity to attend to and weigh in on these matters. Specifically, we realized in that first meeting that we as students were interested in pursuing the question, “How does social media influence perceptions of reality and/or current events?” Thus, that’s what we did for several weeks. Echo chambers, multi-level marketing schemes, airbrushing apps, misinformation, and more—throughout our research and writing, we investigated a wide range of rhetorical events and rhetorical appeals on social media, hoping to gain shared insight into how social media rhetorics influence our lives.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">That said, our overall focus shifted soon after our research began. Although our seminar and our project weren’t originally designed to focus on research methods and methodologies, we quickly realized that this focus was better suited and more motivating to us. Inspired by the interdisciplinary need for social media research methods and methodologies, we decided to use our individual research and writing projects to experiment with approaches that might contribute to this work. To do so, we spent time as a group discussing the current challenges facing social media research. As Sarah has argued elsewhere, social media is emergent media with emergent uses and influences, thus researchers need to carefully consider the methodologies they apply to social media research; this may require developing new methods designed for this kind of research (Riddick, 2019). Moreover, established methodological approaches support some researchers and stakeholders more than others. As Joseph T. Yun, Nickolas Vance, Chen Wang, Joseph Troy, Luigi Marini, Robert Booth, Todd Nelson, Ashley Hetrick, and Hagen Hodekins (2018) pointed out, “There is no shortage of social media analytics tools and environments across both industry and academia, but most of these tools and environments are built in a way that favors usage by companies or those with computer science backgrounds” (Yun et al.). In other words, there are multiple barriers to access for those interested in researching social media, including digital humanities researchers and students.</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">In this way, we felt particularly motivated as a group to join this conversation. Our university’s mission illustrates this motivation well: “WPI’s mission is to create, discover, and convey knowledge at the frontiers of technological academic inquiry for the betterment of society” (Mission & goals, n.d.). Our university highly values collaborative, interdisciplinary approaches to science and technology, as evidenced by our curriculum’s series of team-based, interdisciplinary research projects. We highly value this work, too, and we were excited to contribute to it as an interdisciplinary group (i.e., undergraduate STEM students and a humanities professor).
      <p class="w3-justify">Moreover, we believe our work is important in this area not only because it comes from a group with different disciplines and training, but also different <em>levels</em> of training. Educators are increasingly incorporating social media in their classrooms, including asking students to study and use it. Rhetoric & writing classrooms feature this pedagogical work well. Indeed, rhetoric & writing scholars understand the importance of training students to communicate persuasively with digital media and technology, thus rhetoric & writing courses often offer substantive opportunities for students to further develop and refine their approaches to social-media rhetoric & writing (Bowdon, 2013; Hurley and Hea, 2014; McGregor, 2021). Moreover, and as journals like <em>Kairos</em> exemplify, rhetoric & writing scholars prioritize pedagogical research that supports such efforts. This scholarship carefully considers best practices for incorporating social media into coursework, for supporting students’ needs in these assignments, for minimizing risks that students face on social media, and for acknowledging students’ existing rhetorical capacities (Buck, 2015; Carlson, 2018; Daer and Potts, 2014; Vie, 2017).</p>
      <p class="w3-justify">Building on this last point, we are interested in seeing students contribute more directly to the scholarly conversations that inform social-media coursework and perhaps beyond. As danah boyd (2014) observed, “So many people talk about youth engagement with social media, but very few of them are willing to take the time to listen to teens, to hear them, or to pay attention to what they have to say about their lives, online and off" (x). We appreciate that rhetoric & writing research often includes youth and student voices through methodological approaches like interviews and ethnographic study (e.g., Amicucci, 2017; Buck, 2015). In our case, we felt inspired to speak similarly to the students in the “‘Stronger Together’” project—that is, not as participants, but as researchers. Although our group does not have as much formal training and research experience with certain areas as Sarah (i.e., digital humanities, rhetoric & writing, social media), we have considerable firsthand experience with navigating social media rhetoric & writing (i.e., years of personal social-media use), and we have varied experience with working on research teams (i.e., WPI’s curriculum). Thus, for seven weeks, we worked together as a collaborative learning and research team. Sarah led the project, providing mentorship and instruction along the way, while also working with us to customize the course and our collaborative project at each step. In the next section, we showcase this process in detail.</p>

    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">RECOMMENDATIONS</h2>
  </body>
  </html>
      <p class="w3-justify">In the timeline above, we provided a chronological overview of the project's phases and components. In this final section, we further reflect on this project's successes and challenges. Specifically, we provide three recommendations that are informed by
        our work.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="w3-justify">As we discussed above in the "Writing Together" section, some pedagogical challenges accompanied this seminar. Thus, Sarah prepared in advance a full structure for the seminar (i.e., lesson plans, activities, assignments, readings, and resources) to offer us each week and to customize as needed. Still, even with this support in place from the start, an ongoing priority remained each week for Sarah: identifying efficient, accessible approaches to the seminar’s main themes and topics. Our seminar’s brief timeline, our larger curricular context, and our individual and collaborative research and writing aims required this approach, and Sarah included us in the process. Each week, Sarah offered us resources while also consulting with us about customizations for our coursework and adapting our coursework to align with our goals and needs. </p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Below, we offer three main recommendations for other groups who would like to pursue similar, collaborative research projects in the rhetoric & writing classroom.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify"><strong>1) Before the course/project begins: prepare accessible resources on rhetoric & writing, and possibly on the course/project’s specific subject matter.</strong> Although we each had already completed our “depth” in the literature/writing/rhetoric coursework area, this coursework is not equal to completing a minor or major. For instance, rhetoric was not a shared area of specialization in our coursework. Thus, each week Sarah offered us optional readings from rhetoric textbooks that aligned with our work that week. She explained:</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">“There are two suggested textbooks in this course. Each week I’ll suggest chapters from these textbooks that are intended to support your coursework at that time. [. . .] Refer to each text (as much) as needed for <em>you</em>; I expect that will vary from one person to the next. Read; skim; choose your own adventure. These texts are here to help you. You won’t be tested on them (i.e., no quizzes or exams). Instead, you’ll demonstrate your proficiency with the concepts, terms, and practices featured in these texts by strategically and creatively employing them in your coursework” (Riddick, 2021).</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">In addition, throughout our meetings we reviewed key rhetorical concepts related to our research and writing projects; for instance, to prepare for our Commonplace Papers, we reviewed the ancient Greek concept of <em>topos</em>. Likewise, we reviewed the key concepts in the rhetorical situation and the features of rhetorical analysis, which we were invited to apply across our assignments. One concept that we found particularly useful and that we ended up citing frequently in our weekly research and writing was Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole DeVoss’ (2009) <em>rhetorical velocity</em>, or "a way of considering delivery as a rhetorical mode, aligned with an understanding of how texts work as a component of a strategy" (Ridoflo & DeVoss, 2009).</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Sarah took a similar approach with writing. Each week, she’d suggest readings from the writing textbook <em>They Say / I Say</em> that aligned with our writing work that week (Graff and Birkenstein, 2018). Likewise, as our timeline illustrates, we would spend part of our meetings reviewing writing strategies, analyzing writing genres, and workshopping our writing.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Sarah had two main aims with this approach: first, to provide us with a customizable set of resources for reviewing foundational terms, concepts, and methods in rhetoric & writing studies; and second, to give us sufficient time outside of class to focus on research. Given the advanced level of the course, our reading priorities needed to be focused on our individual research projects. The Collaborative Annotated Bibliography, which we completed in Week Two, helped us efficiently form that foundation. Overall, we drew on all of the above resources each week to support our research and writing.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Given how much ground we needed to cover, this approach was generally a success. That said, we admit that this <em>is</em> a lot of ground to cover in a brief amount of time, and our success is limited. Unfortunately, one of our ongoing struggles was diving deep enough into rhetoric while also attending to the project’s development, going over assignments, workshopping our writing, and completing other in-class work. Ideally, groups who want to pursue this kind of collaborative project would share a larger foundation in rhetoric & writing studies <em>before</em> the project begins. If not, the instructor could ask students to familiarize themselves with the basics of rhetoric and rhetorical analysis by having them read some first-year readings before the first day of class. Alternatively, if the course has time for three units, the first unit could focus on reviewing rhetoric.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify"><strong>2) In the beginning of the course/project: prioritize establishing research methods and methodologies.</strong> Thanks to our university curriculum’s emphasis on project-based learning and student research—which we discuss further below—we were relatively well-prepared to pursue a collaborative research project together. That said, a collaborative research project requires the group to collaborate on methods and methodologies. For our project—that is, a research project about social media rhetorics—we needed to identify methodological approaches that met several needs.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">First, we needed methods and methodologies that were accessible to our interdisciplinary group of one rhetoric & writing professor and ten undergraduate STEM students. Digital humanities scholarship encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and approaches (Kirschenbaum, 2012), which encouraged us. That said, we didn’t have much time together to explore methodological options. Thus, we used rhetorical analysis as a broad methodological approach.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Second, we needed methods and methodologies that would suit research about social media rhetorics. For instance, in our Platform Reports, we each experimented with using, adapting, and creating methods and methodologies for researching and writing about social media rhetorics. Again, we found success in this approach, but we also encountered limitations. Directly and repeatedly exploring methods and methodologies helped us have more focused conversations in the classroom about the relationship between rhetoric, writing, and research; it also helped us understand how the methods and methodologies we use can influence our data collection, as well as how the way we analyze and write about that data can influence our research subjects, audience members, stakeholders, and more. Unfortunately, although we spent a lot of time experimenting in our individual work, we did not have much time to survey established approaches together.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">For groups who are interested in this kind of project, we have three suggestions regarding methods and methodologies. First, the instructor might prepare in advance a selection of resources that provides an overview of a few recommended approaches; ideally, they would discuss these options in class with the students, including the uses and limitations of each. Second, if the course/project has a longer timeline than ours (e.g., a semester), the instructor could follow the three-unit structure, in which the second unit focuses more intensively on methods and methodologies. Third—but certainly not least—if the group might end up presenting this work beyond the classroom, the instructor should proactively consult relevant parties before the research begins. For instance, as our timeline explains, Sarah met with the university’s IRB office in January, and she had conversations with us upfront about why this step was necessary if we were hoping to publish our research. Even though our project ended up not requiring IRB approval, we nevertheless reviewed what IRB is and how it relates to research projects like ours. Part of this conversation included discussing the methodological challenges of researching social media rhetorics, where the line between textual analysis and human-subjects research is not as well-established as offline research. In addition, Sarah gave us the option of completing the basic IRB training course as another way in which we could customize our coursework; several of us chose to complete this training; this free training is another resource that instructors could provide to students.</p>

        <p class="w3-justify"><strong>3) During the course/project: actively check-in and make adjustments.</strong> Given the brevity of our time together in this seminar, we are proud of how much we accomplished. We conducted primary and secondary research about social media rhetorics, experimented with methods and methodologies, rhetorically analyzed a variety of rhetorical events, improved our understanding of the writing process, and applied all of the above to various writing genres (e.g., academic journal articles, blogs, synthesis papers). This work culminated here: a collaboratively composed scholarly webtext.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify"> Of course, our success is limited in a few ways, namely our limited time together and our lack of a stronger, shared disciplinary foundation. On the other hand, our interdisciplinary background and our collective experiences with developing research projects on similar timelines helped us reach our goals. Notably, we reached these goals by actively working together at each step to reflect on our work thus far and to proceed carefully with the next round of research and writing. As noted above in the “Writing Together” section, we shifted our project early on into a methods-based research question. This was an active shift; the possibility of it emerged after we completed Platform Report #1, and we dedicated multiple hours to discussing and exploring this new potential framing before settling on it.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">We took this kind of active reflective approach throughout the project. Between our meetings, we individually reflected on our own projects, and we experimented with specific adjustments that we documented in our assignments. In our meetings, we reviewed and synthesized our results, and we worked together to adjust the course and the collaborative writing project so that both continued to suit our interests and goals. For groups interested in this kind of project, we recommend building in time at each meeting to check-in with one another, including to attend to new questions, concerns, and ideas, as well as to gauge ongoing interest. <p class="w3-justify"> Along these lines, it is worth noting that we checked in with each other about this last point at every meeting: Sarah provided anonymous polls to gauge interest each week, offered alternative coursework pathways to any student who did not want to participate in the Collaborative Writing Project, and let us know that she would check in again after the course had ended in case any one wanted to opt out then (which she did). No one opted out. For instructors wanting to pursue this kind of project, we recommend providing all of the above to students.</p>
        <p class="w3-justify">Throughout our project, we have acknowledged the project's challenges, and we have worked together to address them as best we could, with the revised goal of creating a webtext that showcases all of the above. Our hope is that our webtext will serve as a detailed pedagogical resource for those interested in pursuing similar projects in rhetoric & writing courses. We are excited to see which projects might emerge, for instance, from groups with more time to meet together and/or more rhetoric & writing majors/minors on the team. Such a group—who would have more time and/or prior disciplinary training—could possibly engage more closely with research questions about social media rhetoric & writing. That said, regardless of the group, any collaborative project like ours would benefit from what we have recommended: accessible and customizable approaches; proactive conversations about method and methodologies; and active check-ins. Ultimately, we hope our work together—including how we responded to its challenges—inspires participants in other, perhaps similarly populated courses to pursue this kind of collaborative, interdisciplinary, digital humanities research and writing.</p>
